In layer 3 head 10

I noticed that the model made the pattern good as it makes a pattern of the word and it's Consecutive , and this is the same as the one mentiones in the understanding section

Layer 12 Head 12
and notcied that the word mask is lightley attatched to the word france, which i don't understand it as the mask word was describing the taste of the cheese from France, and all the other words attatched to the SEP

I looked also at layer 9 head 11 , and i felt happy cuz (it) attached very much on (cheese) which is true
all the avove for the sentnence [cheese from France tasting so [MASK], i love it]


Example Sentences:
- cheese from France tasting so [MASK], i love it
