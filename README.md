## 🔍 Search (Week 0)  
### 🎭 Degrees  
Using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path between two actors based on shared movie appearances. Inspired by the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon problem.

### ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe (Minimax Algorithm)  
Implemented an **AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe** player using the **Minimax** algorithm to make optimal moves.

## 🧠 Knowledge (Week 1)  
### 💣 Minesweeper  
Built an AI agent that plays **Minesweeper** by using **logical inference** to deduce safe moves based on surrounding cell values.

## 🎲 Uncertainty (Week 2)  
### 🌎 PageRank  
Implemented Google's **PageRank** algorithm using both **random walk simulations** and **iterative convergence** to rank webpages based on link importance.

### 🧬 Heredity  
Used **Bayesian Networks** to model genetic inheritance of a hearing impairment gene, predicting the probability of inheritance based on family history.

## 🏆 Optimization (Week 3)  
### ✍️ Crossword Puzzle  
Solved crossword generation as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** using **backtracking search** and **arc consistency** techniques.

## 🤖 Machine Learning (Week 4)  
### 🛍️ Shopping Intent Prediction  
Built a **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier** to predict whether a user will make a purchase based on website activity data.

### 🎮 Nim (Reinforcement Learning)  
Developed an AI that learns to play **Nim** using **Q-learning**, improving its strategy over time by playing against itself.

## 🧬 Neural Networks (Week 5)  
### 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition  
Trained a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify traffic signs using an image dataset, enhancing road safety applications.

## 📖 Natural Language Processing (Week 6)  
### 📜 Parser (Context-Free Grammars)  
Designed a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) parser** using **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** to extract noun phrases from sentences.

### 🧠 Attention Analysis (BERT)  
Explored the **BERT Transformer Model**, implementing a masked language model and generating **attention heatmaps** for different layers.
